or **Tools for automated image analysis** in social sciences shall hatch into a researcher-friendly desktop application. This application will allow sending images for tagging via multiple image recognition services, for example IBM Watson and Microsoft Azure. When the image recognition process is complete, the application shows tags and their accuracy. You can also export the data in CSV, JSON, and SQLite format.
